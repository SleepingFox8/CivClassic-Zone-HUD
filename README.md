# CivClassic-Zone-HUD

This repository uses [advanced macros mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-macros) ``v9.2.0`` to provide the user with a HUD that displays the name of the player's current location in CivClassic. Zone data is automatically downloaded from https://github.com/ccmap/data/blob/master/land_claims.civmap.json on each run of the script, so that your information is always up to date.

## Visualization

For an updated visualization of zones, please see the ``Land Claims`` visualization on [ccmap](https://ccmap.github.io/)
